---

### 📱 [Testing Quadrants Model](testingQuadrantsModel.md)

- The Testing Quadrants model, introduced by Brian Marick, is a widely recognized framework in software testing that categorizes testing activities based on their purpose and the development lifecycle stage. It helps Quality Assurance (QA) teams, developers, and stakeholders align testing efforts with business goals and technical requirements. The model is particularly popular in Agile and DevOps environments, where iterative development and continuous feedback are key.

---

### 📱 [Testing Process](testProcessISTQB.md)

- Overview of the standard software testing process as defined by ISTQB, including key phases, activities, and deliverables.
- Learn how each phase contributes to effective and efficient software quality assurance.
