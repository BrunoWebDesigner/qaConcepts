# ðŸš€ Getting Started with AI Testing Assistant

This guide will walk you through setting up, running, and using the **AI Testing Assistant** project to generate high-quality manual test cases from any web page.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+ recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

---

## 2. Project Setup

### a. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BrunoWebDesigner/ManualTestGenerator.git
cd aiTestingAssistant
```

### b. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### c. Install Playwright Browsers

```bash
npx playwright install
```

---

## 3. Analyzing a Web Page

The project uses Playwright to extract UI metadata from a target web page.

### a. Configure the Target URL

Open [`analyzePage.spec.ts`](analyzePage.spec.ts) and set the URL of the page you want to analyze.

### b. Run the Playwright Analysis

```bash
npx playwright test analyzePage.spec.ts
```

- This will visit the target page and generate a [`rich-analysis.json`](rich-analysis.json) file containing structured UI data.

---

## 4. Generating Manual Test Cases

### a. Use the Prompt

- The prompt in [`copilotPrompt.md`](copilotPrompt.md) guides an AI assistant to generate Markdown test cases based on `rich-analysis.json`.

### b. Generate Test Cases

- Use your preferred AI assistant (such as GitHub Copilot Chat or ChatGPT) and provide:
  - The content of `copilotPrompt.md`
  - The latest `rich-analysis.json`
- The AI will output a Markdown file (e.g., [`testCases/youtube-manual-test-cases.md`](testCases/youtube-manual-test-cases.md)) with manual test cases.

---

## 5. Reviewing & Using Test Cases

- Find generated test cases in the [`testCases/`](testCases/) directory.
- Review and execute them as part of your manual QA process.
- Share with your team for collaborative testing.

---

## 6. Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies and browsers
npm install
npx playwright install

# 2. Analyze a web page
npx playwright test analyzePage.spec.ts

# 3. Generate test cases using copilotPrompt.md and rich-analysis.json
#    (Use your AI assistant as described above)
```

---

## 7. Customization

- **Prompt:** Edit [`copilotPrompt.md`](copilotPrompt.md) to change test case format or coverage.
- **Playwright Script:** Modify [`analyzePage.spec.ts`](analyzePage.spec.ts) to target different URLs or extract more data.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting

- If Playwright fails, ensure your Node.js and browser versions are up to date.
- Check that the target URL is accessible and not behind authentication (unless handled in your script).

---

## 9. Resources

- [Playwright Documentation](https://playwright.dev/)
- [Node.js Documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)
- [AI Testing Assistant README](README.md)
