# Bug/Defect Life Cycle and Application in QA Work

The bug or defect life cycle is a critical part of software quality assurance. It provides a structured approach to identifying, reporting, fixing, and verifying issues in software development. Below is a detailed explanation of the stages of the bug life cycle and practical applications for QA daily tasks.

The diagram above illustrates the flow of the bug life cycle, highlighting various stages and transitions between them.

## Stages of Bug/Defect Life Cycle

### 1. **New**
- **Description**: A defect is discovered and reported by a tester. It is assigned the status `New`.
- **QA Action**: Document the defect in detail, including reproduction steps, screenshots, and expected versus actual results.

### 2. **Assigned**
- **Description**: The bug is reviewed and assigned to a developer for resolution.
- **QA Action**: Ensure the defect is assigned to the correct developer and provide clarifications if needed.

### 3. **Open**
- **Description**: The developer starts analyzing and working on fixing the defect.
- **QA Action**: Be available to provide additional information, such as logs or environment details.

### 4. **Fixed**
- **Description**: The developer fixes the defect and updates the status to `Fixed`.
- **QA Action**: Prepare for retesting by reviewing the fix details.

### 5. **Test**
- **Description**: The fixed defect is assigned back to the QA team for validation.
- **QA Action**: Perform regression testing and verify if the defect is resolved as expected.

### 6. **Verified**
- **Description**: If the defect is fixed and no further issues are found, its status is updated to `Verified`.
- **QA Action**: Confirm that the fix meets requirements and that no new issues are introduced.

### 7. **Closed**
- **Description**: The defect is considered resolved and closed after verification.
- **QA Action**: Mark the defect as closed in the tracking system and document any lessons learned.

### 8. **Reopened**
- **Description**: If the issue persists or reoccurs, the defect is reopened and reassigned to the developer.
- **QA Action**: Provide additional evidence of the issue to the developer and collaborate on resolution.

### Special Cases
- **Duplicate**: The defect has already been reported. It is marked as a duplicate.
- **Rejected**: The reported defect is not valid or reproducible.
- **Deferred**: The defect is valid but postponed to a later release due to priority or impact.
- **Next Release**: Defects marked as deferred are scheduled for resolution in the upcoming release.

## Applying Bug Life Cycle in QA Daily Work

### 1. **Systematic Bug Reporting**
QA engineers should ensure clear, concise, and detailed bug reports. Include:
- Steps to reproduce.
- Screenshots, logs, or videos.
- Expected and actual results.

### 2. **Communication and Collaboration**
- Communicate effectively with developers during the **Assigned** and **Open** stages.
- Provide any additional information or clarify misunderstandings promptly.

### 3. **Prioritization**
- Focus on critical and high-severity defects.
- Work with the product team to defer non-critical defects to future releases.

### 4. **Regression Testing**
- Ensure that fixes do not introduce new issues.
- Validate related functionality to maintain overall software stability.

### 5. **Documentation**
- Maintain accurate and up-to-date records of all defects throughout the life cycle.
- Use tools like JIRA, Bugzilla, or Azure DevOps for tracking.

### 6. **Continuous Improvement**
- Analyze closed defects for patterns.
- Provide feedback to improve development and testing processes.

## Conclusion
Understanding and implementing the bug life cycle effectively ensures high-quality software delivery. By following the structured approach outlined in this document, QA engineers can enhance their daily workflows and contribute significantly to the success of software projects.
